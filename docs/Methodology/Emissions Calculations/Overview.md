## Overview

The Open Grid Emissions Initiative includes power sector emissions data for the three primary greenhouse gases (GHGs), CO2, CH4, and N2O, as well as other air pollutants including NOx and SO2. These data represent only direct power sector emissions from the combustion or consumption of fossil, biogenic, and other fuels. This dataset does not include any lifecycle emissions related to the extraction or transportation of these fuels, or the construction or operation of the power plant. Emissions are reported both on a mass basis, and on an intensity basis (in the form of an emission factor that represents emissions mass normalized by generation of consumption of electricity). In addition to reporting total emissions, the OGEI also includes emissions data that has been adjusted for biomass emissions and for combined heat and power (CHP) plants. 

The published data reflects a mix of measured and estimated emissions data. The CEMS dataset reports measured emissions mass values for CO2, NOx, and SO2. All CH4 and N2O emissions, as well as CO2, NOx, and SO2 emissions for plants that do not report to CEMS are estimated based on the reported heat input of each fuel consumed and fuel-specific emission factors.

## Production-based Emissions

Production-based emission factors describe the emissions intensity of generated electricity injected into the grid, and are calculated as 

$$ emission\_mass\_lb \over net\_generation\_mwh $$
